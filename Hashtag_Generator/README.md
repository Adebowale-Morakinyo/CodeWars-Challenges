# Hashtag Generator

The marketing team is spending way too much time typing in hashtags. Let's help them with our own Hashtag Generator!

## Challenge Description

Given an input string `s`, the Hashtag Generator must return a hashtag that adheres to the following rules:

1. It must start with a hashtag (#).
2. All words in the string must have their first letter capitalized.
3. If the final result is longer than 140 characters, it must return `False`.
4. If the input or the result is an empty string, it must also return `False`.

## Examples

- Input: `" Hello there thanks for trying my Kata"`
  Output: `#HelloThereThanksForTryingMyKata`

- Input: `"    Hello     World   "`
  Output: `#HelloWorld`

- Input: `""`
  Output: `False`

## Implementation

The solution for the Hashtag Generator challenge can be found in the `hashtag_generator.py` file. The `generate_hashtag(s)` function takes an input string `s` and returns the corresponding hashtag based on the specified rules.
