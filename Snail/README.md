## Snail Sort

The `snail` function takes an n x n array and returns the array elements arranged from outermost elements to the middle element, traveling clockwise.

### Example

For the array:
```python
array = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
```
The snail(snail_map) should return ```[1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5].```

### Constraints
- The input array ```snail_map``` is a list of lists containing integers.

- The length of array is between 0 and 100.
