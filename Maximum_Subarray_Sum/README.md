# Maximum Subarray Sum

The maximum sum subarray problem consists of finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence in an array or list of integers.

## Examples

Input:
```python
max_sequence([-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4])
```
Output:
```The maximum sum subarray in the input list is [4, -1, 2, 1], and the sum of this subarray is 6.```


## Implementation
The solution for the Maximum Subarray Sum challenge can be found in the max_subarray_sum.py file. The max_sequence(arr) function takes a list of integers arr and returns the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.

This problem is typically solved using the Kadane's algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(n).
