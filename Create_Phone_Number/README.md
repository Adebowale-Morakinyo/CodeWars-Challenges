# Create Phone Number

Write a function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9) and returns a string representing those numbers in the form of a phone number.

## Example

Input:
```python
create_phone_number([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0])
```

Output:
```(123) 456-7890```

The returned format must be correct in order to complete this challenge. Don't forget the space after the closing parentheses!

## Implementation
The solution for the Create Phone Number challenge can be found in the create_phone_number.py file. The create_phone_number(n) function takes an array of 10 integers and returns a string representing the phone number in the specified format.
