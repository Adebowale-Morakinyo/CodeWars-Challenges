# ROT13

This folder contains a Python solution to the ROT13 challenge.

## Challenge Description

How can you tell an extrovert from an introvert at NSA?
Va gur ryringbef, gur rkgebireg ybbxf ng gur BGURE thl'f fubrf.

I found this joke on USENET, but the punchline is scrambled. Maybe you can decipher it?
According to Wikipedia, ROT13 is frequently used to obfuscate jokes on USENET.

For this task, you're only supposed to substitute characters. Not spaces, punctuation, numbers, etc.

## Example

Input: `"EBG13 rknzcyr."`  
Output: `"ROT13 example."`

## How to Use

1. Open the `rot13.py` file to view the solution code.
2. Run the code using a Python interpreter.
3. Provide the input string as an argument to the `rot13` function to get the ROT13 deciphered string.

Feel free to explore the solution code and try it with different input strings!
